            <h1>What Is Student Exchange?</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
            They say time flies when you’re having fun! My six months in Europe went by so quickly, and I still can’t believe it’s over already! Student exchange has been the best experience of my life, but it has also been an eye opening experience. I traveled to fifteen countries during my trip and experienced their unique cultures and lifestyles. I have walked on yellow, white, red, and even black sand all across Europe and even had the opportunity to see a volcano erupt in the middle of Mediterranean Sea – something only a lucky few witness in their lifetime. I partied in Ibiza while staying in an extravagant mansion with friends from all around the world. I also backpacked by the Italian coastline where I would sleep in benches, tables, and even the beach, which was so rewarding! I did a road trip with my best friend where we would sleep in the car and eat tomatoes for dinner. I jumped from cliffs in Cinque Terre that could have potentially destroyed my life. I witnessed the longest jager-bomb train in the world, went into the baths of Hungary, tried water hover boarding in Greece, partied with the Portuguese people on the Feast of St Anthony, spray painted the John Lennon wall and much more! I could continue to describe my experiences but this would become an essay worthy of a thesis presentation.

            The best experience I have had while on this exchange is meeting the other exchange students in Essex. I have met so many amazing people from all around the world. I believe this is because we all think alike in some way. Most of us on student exchange seeked out this opportunity, showing a willingness for adventure, challenges, and the unknown. I believe most people who do student exchange are open-minded, who are optimistic towards everything they do in life. We are all culturally different, come from completely different time zones, and have different type of pigments. I made such a diverse and unique group of friends, who I will never forget. I know that whenever I’m in their city, I have a place to stay because of the relationships I’ve made.
