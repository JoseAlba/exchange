			<h1>What Is Student Exchange?</h1>
		</header>

		<p>
			The University of Windsor has developed a broad range of student exchange partnerships with other universities and post-secondary institutions around the world. Currently we have variety of programs in a variety of countries, involving many different partner institutions, including every continent except for Antarctica.		</p>
		<p>
			Students who participate in one of these exchanges invariably report that it is the single most valuable part of their university experience.		</p>
		<p>
			Normally, students go on exchange for one or two semesters after completion of four or more semesters of study at the University of Windsor. No tuition is charged by the partner institution, as students continue to pay their University of Windsor tuition while they are away. Some financial assistance is also available. All course credits obtained on exchange may be applied to the University of Windsor degree requirements as appropriate.		</p>
		<p>
			While some exchanges allow students to take their courses in English, students are particularly encouraged to consider exchanges which will promote second-language competence. In these cases, students should prepare by enrolling in relevant language courses at the University of Windsor from the time they begin their studies here. A list of current partnerships can be found HERE . Others are currently under development.		</p>

			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Do I get academic credit for my studies abroad?
		</p>
		<p>
			YES - Credits earned while on Exchange are transferred to your University of Windsor transcript. Grades for courses taken at external institutions are also listed on your transcript and will be included in the calculation of your University of Windsor averages (this does not apply for Law or MBA students).
		</p>
		<br><br>

		<p>
			Why should I participate in an exchange program?
		</p>
		<p>
			Participating in an exchange program provides you with the opportunity to gain a varied perspective on your course of study. You will gain global competencies that will enhance your marketability and provide you with a competitive edge. Everyone has their own reasons. Explore yours!
		</p>
		<br><br>

		<p>
			Who can participate in an exchange program?
		</p>
		<p>
			Students who have completed approximately 20 classes by the time of departure
			Students who have a minimum B- average (72% cumulative GPA) at the time of application.
			Students who have proficiency in the host country’s language (if necessary).
			Part-time students at the University of Windsor may participate, however, you are expected to study full-time while abroad.
			It is recommended that you apply during your second year to spend your third year abroad.
			Some exchanges are restricted to certain disciplines.
		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			Why is it preferred that I study abroad during my third year?
		</p>
		<p>
			By third year, you should have adapted to the demands of university life and have the skills required for study in a foreign teaching environment. Students finishing their first year of studies often do not have the prerequisites to pursue studies at the host institute.
			Those in their final year have less flexibility in course selection and may have difficulties finding courses abroad. There may be exceptions to the above.

		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			How do I start the application process? Where can I get an application?

		</p>
		<p>
			The application is completed online.
			The deadline for applications is January 15th for an exchange starting in the Fall semester, and September 15th for an exchange starting in the Winter semester.
			Please note: there are usually not a full range of destinations available for Winter semester applications.
			In addition to the online application, you will need three reference letters (on the form provided). You can print the required reference form from the Exchange website. Please note - at least one of your references must be from a University of Windsor faculty member.
			If all the spaces at any particular destination are filled by students going for 1 or 2 semesters exchanges starting in the Fall semester, then this destination will not be available for Winter semester applications.
			The one major exception to this would be the schools in the Southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Chile), where the school year starts in the February/March.
		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			If I only speak English, can I still go on exchange?
		</p>
		<p>
			YES - the language of instruction at many of the University of Windsor’s partner universities is English.
			Some partners offer intensive language training before or during the semester to improve your language skills. Students need to have at least an intermediate level proficiency before considering a second language exchange.

		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			How long will I be away?
		</p>
		<p>
			In some programs only one semester is permitted; at some partners you can only attend for a full academic year; otherwise you can often choose between one or two semesters on exchange.

			Students doing an exchange in another language are normally expected to complete two semesters on Exchange.

			You can do at most two semesters on exchange during your current degree.
		</p>
		<br><br>

		<p>
			Will my participation delay graduation?
		</p>
		<p>
			NO - An Exchange experience planned appropriately and in consultation with your academic department is intended to be an integral part of your degree program without delaying graduation.

			Students wishing to pursue interests outside their degree program through a semester or year on Exchange may need to extend the duration of their degree program.

			Please note: if you go on exchange in your final semester, your convocation might be delayed due to the time required for processing transfer credit. What this might mean for students on exchange in the Winter semester is that your degree will be awarded at the October convocation ceremony, and not in June.

		<p>
			How much will it cost?
		</p>
		<p>
			The costs are probably not as much as you might think, and most returned students say the benefits greatly out weigh the costs.

			Expenses include:

			Tuition Cost - you pay the same tuition and ancillary fees (except the various association fees) as you would have if you had been staying in Windsor. You pay no tuition fees to the host school.

			Travel Costs - students are responsible for arranging and paying their own travel. Costs vary according to where you are going and when. Costs for visa, passport and other documents will also need to be paid.

			Accommodation Costs - students are responsible for the cost of their accommodations. In most cases residence is available. The host university will help students to find suitable accommodations.  Costs can vary considerably.

			Insurance - OHIP insurance is not adequate and students must purchase additional health insurance. In most cases, this is available through the partner institution.  Other forms of insurance, such as flight insurance and liability coverage should also be considered

		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			Is there any financial assistance available?
		</p>
		<p>
			YES - Students remain eligible for the undergraduate bursaries and scholarships that they otherwise would have qualified for if they were studying in Windsor. There are a number of Awards that are country or program specific - this information is listed in the Financial Assistance section of the website.

			OSAP recipients retain their eligibility.

			The University of Windsor International Mobility Award is available to all students who demonstrate financial need. You can receive $750 for one semester or $1500 for two semesters.

		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			How are students selected for exchange?
		</p>
		<p>
			A selection committee reviews the applications and interviews qualified applicants. Candidates are ranked and offered placements at partner universities based upon:
			Seriousness of interest - for example: have you spent time on the internet researching the school(s) you have applied for ?
			Suitability of the host institution’s program for degree requirements - does the school have classes that you are going to the interested in taking?
			Ability to be a good ambassador and representative of the University and the city while away.
			While you are in no way expected to have made a schedule of classes when you are making your application for exchange, if you have noticed some interesting classes, it would add value to your application to mention them
			Personal adaptability
			Participation in university and community life
			Academic ability
			** The number of placements at each partner schools is limited, therefore applicants are asked to make first, second, and third choices when applying

		</p>
		<br><br>


		<p>
			Can I work while on Exchange?
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe yes, maybe no . . .

			Students going on exchange might or might not be able to work part-time while on exchange, depending on the rules and regulations in effect in the country where they will study.

			* You should not count on part-time work to meet basic expenses while on Exchange.

		</p>
		<br><br>





		<p>
			Where will I live?
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of the Exchange Agreements that we have with each of our partner schools is an understanding that they will help you find suitable accommodations.  Often this means residence, but not always.  You also have the option to find your own accommodations if this is what you want to do.

			You should have a reasonable understanding of where you are going to live before you depart, and therefore you should not need to start looking for a place once you arrive (unless you want to)

			The cost of accommodations will vary depending on where and how you want to live (big room versus a small room for example).  Most universities have cost information on their websites so you should do some exploring.

			All costs associated with accommodations are your responsibility to pay.
